# Antony Repin — Engineer & Digital Architect

I architect and build production-ready applications with a focus on **TypeScript**, **security**, and **modern web technologies**. My engineering approach emphasizes clean architecture, developer experience, and systems that scale gracefully—*and fail gracefully!*

## 🚀 What I Build

These repositories are my playground, sandbox, and production experiments. Each project represents a different facet of modern web engineering:

**[N8N Deploy Manager](https://github.com/lehcode/n8n-deploy)** — 🔧 Workflow Orchestration
*Because deploying workflows shouldn't be a workflow itself.* Python-based automation with SQLite metadata and sensible CLI design.

**[Angular Fullstack Pro](https://github.com/lehcode/angular-fullstack-pro-starter)** — 🏗️ Enterprise Architecture
*The starter I wish I had years ago. And I had.* NestJS + Angular foundation with MongoDB, Redis, i18n—everything configured properly from day one.

**[Carvin](https://github.com/lehcode/carvin)** — 🚗 Vehicle Intelligence
*Real-world problem, practical solution.* Angular/NestJS app that makes sense of VIN codes using NHTSA APIs.

**[SOAKP](https://github.com/lehcode/soakp)** — 🔐 Secure OpenAI API Proxy
*When you need to talk to AI safely.* JWT authentication, API key rotation, and security patterns that actually work in production.

## 📌 Engineering Philosophy

> *"Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out."* — Hoare's Law of Large Programs

I believe great software comes from understanding that technology serves humans, not the other way around. My code reflects this through:

- **Security by design** — Trust is earned through proper implementation
- **Graceful degradation** — When things break (and they will), they break elegantly
- **Developer happiness** — Tools that don't fight you but work with you
- **Practical innovation** — New tech when it solves real problems, proven patterns when they work

## 🔥 Current Stack & Interests

**Core**: TypeScript, Angular, Vue.js, NestJS, Node.js
**Security**: JWT patterns, API security, authentication flows
**AI/LLM**: OpenAI integration, workflow automation, intelligent tooling
**Infrastructure**: Docker, CI/CD, serverless architectures

*This is where I experiment, learn, and occasionally build something useful.*
